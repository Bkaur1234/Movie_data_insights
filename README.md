# Movie Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes a dataset containing information about movies, including details such as budget, gross earnings, and company involvement. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)), and it was used to explore various aspects of the movie industry.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the movie dataset to uncover insights and trends in the movie industry. By analyzing factors such as budget, gross earnings, and company involvement, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of what contributes to a movie's success.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle's [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies). It contains information about over 45,000 movies, including details such as budget, revenue, genres, and more. The dataset is provided in CSV format and has been preprocessed for analysis.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment used for running Python code and documenting the analysis process.
- Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computing in Python.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries for data visualization.
- GitHub: Version control system used for managing project files and collaboration.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various exploratory analyses were performed to understand the distribution of variables, identify trends, and uncover relationships between features.
3. **Visualization**: Data visualization techniques, including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, were used to visually represent the findings from the analysis.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Correlation matrices were computed to quantify the relationships between numeric features in the dataset.

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- **Correlation Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for correlation analysis and heatmap visualization.
